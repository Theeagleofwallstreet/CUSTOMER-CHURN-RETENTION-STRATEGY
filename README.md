## 🧠 Project Overview
**Churn2Growth** is a data science project completed as part of the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) PowerCo Virtual Experience**.  
The objective was to help **PowerCo**, an energy provider, identify customers at risk of churn and recommend strategies to **boost retention and business growth**.

This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can transform customer relationships and improve revenue stability.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal was to **reduce customer churn** by predicting which clients are most likely to leave and **developing actionable retention strategies** that align with PowerCo’s business goals.

---

## 🧩 Key Tasks
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** – Examined customer usage, contract, and demographic data.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Created churn indicators and customer segments.  
3. **Predictive Modeling** – Trained and evaluated ML models using logistic regression and random forest.  
4. **Business Insight Generation** – Interpreted results to recommend data-backed retention actions.

## 📈 Technologies Used
| Category | Tools & Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Language | Python 🐍 |
| Data Analysis | Pandas, NumPy |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn |
| Notebook | JupyterLab |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |

## 📊 Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.77 | 0.78 |
| Random Forest | 0.88 | 0.85 | 0.84 | 0.84 |

> ✅ **Random Forest** was selected as the final model due to its higher performance and interpretability using feature importance analysis.

---

## 💡 Business Insights
- High consumption variability and short contract duration strongly correlate with churn.  
- Long-term contract incentives can reduce churn risk by **20–25%**.  
- Personalized retention offers should focus on **high-value customers** identified by the model.

---

## 🚀 Results
- **Predicted churn probability** for 5,000+ customers.  
- Identified **top churn drivers** to guide PowerCo’s marketing and retention strategies.  
- Demonstrated how **AI-driven insights** can translate into **business growth and customer loyalty**.
